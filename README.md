# Music Store Data Analysis

### Situation

As an aspiring data analyst, I decided to work on an ETL project for Music to gain hands-on experience in the field. SQL project to analyze online music store data. By leveraging the power of SQL, we'll gain valuable insights into customer behavior, music trends, and overall store performance. You can examine the dataset with SQL and help the store understand its business growth by answering simple questions.

### Task

The project will utilize a dataset comprising tables related to different aspects of the online music store, typically including: Customers: Customer information like ID, name, location, etc. Tracks: Track details like ID, title, artist, genre, etc. Invoices: Invoice information like ID, customer ID, purchase date, etc. Invoice lines: Individual items purchased in an invoice (track ID, quantity, price, etc.). Genres: Genre information like ID, name, etc.

### Action

Setting up the music store database for analysis

- Explaining the structure of the music playlists database and its objective for business growth
- Step-by-step demonstration of importing and restoring the music database in Post Basic

I also developed a suite of SQL queries to validate and compare the data across different sources.

### Result

Identifying countries with the highest number of invoices

- From the Invoice table, count the number of invoices for each country and display the count in descending order.
- Identify the top three countries with the highest number of invoices.

Understanding the process of joining different tables for data analysis

- Identifying the three different tables needed for data analysis: customer data, artist data, and invoice data
- Caution about calculating the total cost based on invoice data and the importance of considering quantity and unit price

### Reflection

Through this project, I learned the importance of designing a scalable and flexible schema to accommodate changing business needs. I also learned the importance of automating the ETL process to ensure data integrity and reduce the risk of errors.

If I were to do this project again, I would spend more time on data profiling and analysis to ensure that the data was properly transformed and loaded. I would also explore the use of newer ETL tools to simplify the process and improve performance.

For anyone interested in doing a similar project, I would advise them to spend ample time on data profiling and analysis before designing the ETL process. It is also important to collaborate closely with the business intelligence team to identify the KPIs and dimensions that will be used for reporting and analysis.
